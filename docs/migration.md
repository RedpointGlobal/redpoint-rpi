# Upgrading from v7.7 to v7.8

[< Back to Home](../README.md)

This guide covers upgrading an existing RPI v7.7 Helm deployment to v7.8. If you're deploying RPI for the first time, see the [Greenfield Installation](greenfield.md) guide instead.

> **Not ready to upgrade?** The `release/v7.7` branch remains available on GitHub for critical fixes. You can stay on v7.7 as long as needed.

<summary><strong style="font-size:1.25em;">What Changed in the Helm Chart</strong></summary>

v7.8 is an additive release. It introduces Google Cloud data-plane support (Cloud SQL and BigQuery) and new Realtime API and Interaction API configuration. Existing v7.7 overrides continue to work unchanged (see the checklist below).

| Area | Change |
|:---|:---|
| Google Cloud SQL | Passwordless IAM connectivity via the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy |
| BigQuery | Data-warehouse support with keyless Workload Identity |
| Realtime API | Expanded geolocation, identity, profile/ML processing, integration, and operational configuration |
| Interaction API | Expanded auth/security, logging, integration, and operational configuration |
| Queue Reader | Expanded logging, integration, distributed-processing, and operational configuration |

### Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) with IAM authentication

RPI can connect to a Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance using passwordless IAM authentication through the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, which runs as a sidecar. With `autoIamAuthn` enabled, pods connect over loopback using the IAM database user and no stored password. This path is SDK secrets mode only (`secretsManagement.provider: sdk`).

```yaml
databases:
  operational:
    provider: postgresql
    databaseSchema: dbo
    cloudSqlProxy:
      enabled: true
      connectionName: my-project:us-central1:my-instance
      autoIamAuthn: true
      privateIp: true
```

See [Google Cloud SQL (IAM)](google-cloud-sql-iam.md) for the full setup, including the required Workload Identity binding.

### BigQuery data warehouse with keyless Workload Identity

The chart renders an ODBC DSN ConfigMap for the Simba BigQuery driver when `databases.datawarehouse.bigquery.enabled` is true, with one DSN per connection. Each connection chooses how it authenticates:

| `credentialsType` | Authentication |
|:---|:---|
| `serviceAccount` | Service-account key file (`serviceAccountEmail` plus a mounted key) |
| `workloadIdentity` | Keyless, via the pod's GCP Workload Identity (Application Default Credentials). No key file is mounted. |

```yaml
databases:
  datawarehouse:
    bigquery:
      enabled: true
      connections:
        - name: gbq-tenant1
          projectId: my-google-project
          credentialsType: workloadIdentity
          OAuthMechanism: 3
```

### Realtime API: expanded configuration

Expanded configuration support for geolocation, identity resolution, visitor and profile processing, logging, integrations, and operational settings, including geolocation and IP-lookup, identity and profile-merge controls, RedPoint ML scoring, file output, SMTP, and service host settings.

```yaml
realtimeapi:
  geolocation:
    enabled: true
    provider: Azure
    weatherUnits: imperial
  RedPointMLServiceAddress: "https://<your-ml-service>"   # address of the RedPoint ML scoring service
  RedPointMLClientID: "<client-id>"                        # client identifier for the ML service
```

### Interaction API: expanded configuration

Expanded configuration support for authentication/security, logging, integrations, and operational settings, including password policies, account lockout, token lifetimes, logging providers, Azure services, and client service credentials.

```yaml
interactionapi:
  passwordPolicy:
    requiredLength: 12
    requireDigit: true
    requireUppercase: true
    requireLowercase: true
    requireNonAlphanumeric: true
```

### Queue Reader: expanded configuration

Expanded configuration support for logging, integrations, distributed processing, and operational settings, including logging providers (New Relic, Loggly), Azure Web PubSub, NLP, SMTP, file output, operational database retry, and the chart-managed internal cache and queue for distributed processing.

```yaml
queuereader:
  logging:
    newRelic:
      enabled: true   # forwards logs to New Relic; ApiKey from shared Secret key NewRelic_ApiKey
```

<summary><strong style="font-size:1.25em;">Removed in v7.8</strong></summary>

### RedpointAI vector search values

`redpointAI.VectorSearchProfile` and `redpointAI.VectorSearchConfig` have been removed. RPI now creates the search index, vector profile, and algorithm dynamically at runtime, so these values are no longer needed. See [Redpoint AI](redpoint-ai.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong style="font-size:1.25em;">Upgrade Checklist</strong></summary>

1. Remove `redpointAI.VectorSearchProfile` and `redpointAI.VectorSearchConfig` if present.
2. Review the new optional features (Cloud SQL IAM, BigQuery, Realtime geolocation, Interaction API password policy) and adopt as needed. All are opt-in and default off.
3. Apply the upgrade with your existing `helm upgrade` command and overrides file.
